                            <p>The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened.  
                                The crowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard now a faint murmur from it.  
                                The little knot of people towards Chobham dispersed.  There was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.

                                    and I suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore confidence.

                            <p>At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent movement upon the sand pits began, 
                                a movement that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken.  
                                Vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch, and advance again, 
                                spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns.  
                                I, too, on my side began to move towards the pit.
                            </p>
                            <p>Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits, and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels.  
                                I saw a lad trundling off the barrow of apples.  And then, within thirty yards of the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, 
                                I noted a little black knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.

                                China is planning to launch its own 'artificial moon' by 2020 to replace streetlamps and lower electricity 
                                costs in urban areas, state media reported Friday.

                                Chengdu, a city in southwestern Sichuan province, is developing "illumination satellites" 
                                which will shine in tandem with the real moon, but are eight times brighter, according to China Daily.
                            </p>

                                Chengdu Aerospace Science and Technology Microelectronics System Research Institute Company plans to 
                                accomplish its lofty goal by creating a satellite that's floating in the sky, mimicking the moon's effect on a city at night. 
                                And while it's unclear whether the idea has been supported by officials in Chengdu or the Chinese government, 
                                some are concerned about the environmental effects the proposal could have on the area. At a moment in time when cities 
                                such as Flagstaff, Arizona, and Ketchum, Idaho, are working to reduce light emissions at night, Chengdu seems, at least with this plan, 
                                to be headed in the opposite direction.
