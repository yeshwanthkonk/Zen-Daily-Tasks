                                    One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. 
                                    He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, 
                                    slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed 
                                    ready to slide off any moment.
                                </p>

                                    "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, 
                                    a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.

                                A labourer has found three diamonds with net weight of 7.5 carat worth ₹30 lakh to ₹35 lakh at a diamond mine in Madhya Pradesh. 
                                The diamonds will be auctioned as per government rules, Panna district's diamond officer R K Pandey said. 
                                After deducting 12% tax, the labourer, identified as Subal, will get the remaining 88% of the sale proceeds.
